pyTrace

README

This was my (successful) attempt at writing a raytracer in python from scratch, with as few external libraries as possible.  

To my amazing surprise, I actually got it to work!

The code is horrible (I mean seriously bad), and it's slow as a dog.  Somewhere around a minute for a 640 * 480 image if memory serves.  And  none of that fancy pants stuff like antialiasing or transparent objects.

Writing a better version of this is high up on the bucket list, but we'll see if I ever get around to it.

Please don't judge me on the code...
